# Flutter Of Legends

Flutter Of Legends is an application that I am doing to study Flutter.

Basically, it displays the champions of the League Of Legends game.

2. Clone this repository, in the terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoisesAbraao/flutter-of-legends.git

As I develop, I will implement new features.
